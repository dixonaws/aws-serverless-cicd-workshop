A buildspec file is a series of commands in YAML format that CodeBuild runs to build your application. 

Create a new file named _buildspec.yml_ in the root of the _sam-app_ directory and copy the following contents into it. **It is very important that the file is placed in the root**, otherwise CodeBuild will not be able to find it.

In Cloud9, right click on the `sam-app` directory to create a new file. Name it `buildspec.yml`.

Then, paste the following content into the file:

```
# ~/environment/sam-app/buildspec.yml

version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      java: corretto11
    commands:
      # Install packages or any pre-reqs in this phase.
      # Upgrading SAM CLI to latest version
      - pip3 install --upgrade aws-sam-cli
      - sam --version
      
  pre_build:
    commands:
      # Run tests, lint scripts or any other pre-build checks.
      - pwd
      - ls -lah
      - cd HelloWorldFunction
      - mvn test
      - java -version
      - mvn -version

  build:
    commands:
      # Use Build phase to build your artifacts (compile, etc.)
      - cd ..
      - sam build

  post_build:
    commands:
      # Use Post-Build for notifications, git tags, upload artifacts to S3
      - sam package --s3-bucket $PACKAGE_BUCKET --output-template-file packaged.yaml

artifacts:
  discard-paths: yes
  files:
    # List of local artifacts that will be passed down the pipeline
    - packaged.yaml
```

**Save the file**. Take a moment to understand the buildspec file.
